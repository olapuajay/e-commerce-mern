# 🛒 Pure Harvest – Multi-Role E-Commerce MERN Stack Platform

**Pure Harvest** is a robust, full-featured e-commerce web application built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform supports **multi-role functionality**—User, Farmer, and Admin—providing a seamless experience for shopping, selling, and managing fresh produce directly from farms to homes.

## 📌 Project Overview

Pure Harvest was developed as a **collaborative group project** to demonstrate full-stack web development and real-world e-commerce application. It promotes local farming by allowing **farmers to sell their products directly to consumers**, with full backend integration and secure workflows.
